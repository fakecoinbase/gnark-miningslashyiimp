// WARNING DO NOT USE THIS IN yespower_hash YET. For later HF to yespower 1.0
// TODO Find HF solution using unixtime or blockheight(recommended)

/*
Parameter selection for yespower 1.0.
For new uses of yespower, set the requested version to the highest
supported, and set N*r to the highest you can reasonably afford in terms
of proof verification time (which might in turn be determined by desired
share rate per mining pool server), using one of the following options:
1 MiB: N = 1024, r = 8
2 MiB: N = 2048, r = 8    (current bitzeny-yescrypt0.5)
4 MiB: N = 1024, r = 32
8 MiB: N = 2048, r = 32   (recommended settings)
16 MiB: N = 4096, r = 32  (It might increase resistance against future GPUs)
and so on for higher N keeping r=32.
You may also set the personalization string to your liking, but that is
not required (you can set its pointer to NULL and its length to 0).  Its
support is provided mostly for compatibility with existing modifications
of yescrypt 0.5.
